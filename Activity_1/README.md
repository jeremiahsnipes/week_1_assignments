### Activity 1 – Implementing ML Lifecycles using Python

This notebook walks through the complete ML workflow for predicting housing prices using the Ames Housing dataset.

### Contents
- `Jeremiah_Snipes_WeekOneActivity_HousingPricePrediction.ipynb`
- `house_prices.csv`

End-to-end analysis including data cleaning, feature engineering, and regression model training (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

### Note
The dataset was not included in the project files; I located the Ames/Kaggle housing dataset manually to complete the activity.
